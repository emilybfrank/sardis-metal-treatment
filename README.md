In the last sixty-one years, the Harvard-Cornell-led archaeological excavations at Sardis, Turkey, have produced over 5,000 copper-alloy and iron finds. Since their excavation, these finds have been stored in on-site depots, which provide only minimal buffer against seasonal fluctuations in relative humidity (RH). A condition survey conducted in 2016 and 2017 detected signs of chloride-related deterioration in roughly 40% of these finds. Conservation records since the 1960s document evolving stabilization treatment methods as new conservation research was put into practice.

*This repository includes the data and code, and a summary paper - the peer reviewed pre-prints of the 19th ICOM-CC Virtual Triennial Conference, Beijing 2021 - illustrating a computational approach used to correlate the history of copper-alloy stabilization treatments at Sardis with deterioration phenomena encountered during the aforementioned survey.*
